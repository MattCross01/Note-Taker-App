# 11-Note-Taker-App
Assignement 11: Note Taking Application using Express JS

* [Live Demo](https://notetakerapp11.herokuapp.com/)

## Overview

This application uses Express, uuid, path, and fs to create a note taking application where a user can create, store, and delete notes. The sample app is deployed using heroku.

## Installation

To install, first make sure you have the dependencies:

`npm install`

To run the application locally, you will use:

`node server.js`

## Strategy

My goal was to follow server and routing structure setups featured in in-class activities. The boilerplate server.js file works well for this application, as well as some previous material for writing files.

## Challenges

For challenges, i would have to say getting the API and HTML routes were quite the challenge to get it working properly through the localhost. Although the application deployed successfully through Heroku, it is still required to get the application to run properly in a local setting.
